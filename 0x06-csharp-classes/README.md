 # 0x06 - C# - Classes & Namespaces
Task # | Short Description
-------|------------
[Task 0](0-enemy/) | Create a new namespace `Enemies`. Create an empty public class `Zombie` within `Enemies` that defines a zombie.
[Task 1](1-enemy/) | Based on `0-enemy`, write a public class `Zombie` that defines a zombie by some stuff.
[Task 2](2-enemy/) | Based on `1-enemy`, add a new public constructor to the public class `Zombie`.
[Task 3](3-enemy/) | Privatize the `health` field & add a new public method `public int GetHealth()`.
[Task 4](4-enemy/) | Name the zombie with a private field `name`. `name` should be a string & have a default value of `(No name)`. Add a public property `Name` that can `get` and `set` `name`.
[Task 5](5-enemy/) | Override the `.toString()` of the Zombie and print the Zombie object's attributes to stdout with the designated format.
