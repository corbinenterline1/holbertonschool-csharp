 # 0x08 - C# - Inheritance
Task # | Short Description
-------|------------
[Task 0](0-is/) | Write a method that returns `True` if the object is an `int`, otherwise return `False`.
[Task 1](1-instance/) | Write a method that returns `True` if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, `Array`, otherwise return `False`.
[Task 2](2-subclass/) | Write a method that returns `True` if the object is an instance of a class that inherits from the specified class, otherwise return `False`. The object must be a subclass; your method cannot return `True` if the object is an instance of the base class.
[Task 3](3-type_get/) | Write a method that prints the names of the available properties and methods of an object. See example for output format.
[Task 4](4-inherit/) | Write an empty class `Dog` that inherits from empty class `Animal`.
[Task 5](5-shape/) | Write a class `Shape` with a public method `public virtual int Area()` that throws an `NotImplementedException` with the message `Area() is not implemented`.
[Task 6](6-shape/) | Based on `5-shape`, write a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `Shape` with some fields and properties and such.
[Task 7](7-shape/) | Based on `6-shape`, write a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `Shape` with all the stuff the lesson asks for.
[Task 8](8-shape/) | Based on `7-shape`, write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` and has stuff with requirements!
[Task 9](9-shape/) | Based on `8-shape`, write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` that's different from the last task.
[Task 10](Blogpostlinkhere) | Blog post that explains the problem with implementing a `Square` class as a deried class of `Rectangle` that covers What Liskov's substitution principle is.

 ## Lessons Learned
* What is inheritance
* How is polymorphism achieved with inheritance
* What is a base class
* What is a derived class
* How to create a derived class
* How to override a method or property inherited from the base class
* What is the difference between the `override` and `new` modifiers
* What are `is`, `.GetType()`, `TypeOf()`, `.IsInstanceOfType()`, and `.IsSubclassOf()` and when to use them.
